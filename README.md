Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jonatan Holmgren
=================================

Hi! I write code, build and break things. In my spare-time I create phenomenal stuff people love, mainly with my friends over at [@v3xlabs](https://github.com/v3xlabs)

I'm always doing stuff. Whether it's [speaking at conferences](https://youtu.be/ILE2TJyU3AE), shipping code to thousands, or building a project in a weekend, it's always something fun. 

Whatever I'm doing it's a public good and usually opensource. I try to make this sphere of dirt a better place, one commit at a time.

Oh, and I'm also a literal child. Below is my age (as of your page load). <br><img height="100px" src="https://api.jontes.page/age.png"/>
